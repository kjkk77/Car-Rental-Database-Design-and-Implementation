# Car-Rental-Database-Design-and-Implementation

This was a group project for ITSS 4300 Database Fundamentals course (spring 2023) at the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX. The members include Sid Sridharan, Hoorad Afshar, Amon Kissi, and the owner of this repository.

  1. Introduction: Specifies the business requirements of a hypothetical car rental company.
  2. Database Design: Documents the brainstorming from each of the members to integrate into the best model.
  3. ERD Refinement & Normalization: Records the improvements to the original ERD & make it into 3NF form.
  4. Database Implementation: Details the SQL queries to make a physical database.
  5. Database Query Trial: Runs a series of queries to ensure the working of the implemented database.
